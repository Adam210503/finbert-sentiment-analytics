# FinBERT: Automated Financial Sentiment Pipeline

An automated data engineering pipeline that collects financial news headlines and equity price data on scheduled intervals, deduplicates and warehouses them in a local SQLite store, and prepares a structured time-series dataset for downstream sentiment analysis using a fine-tuned FinBERT transformer model.

## Overview

This is **Phase 1** of a two-phase project. The pipeline continuously ingests raw financial data and structures it for inference. The inference layer, which covers fine-tuned FinBERT scoring, attention-weight extraction, and correlation analytics, is built in Phase 2.

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Phase 1: Data pipeline | Ingestion, Deduplication, SQLite persistence, and Observability | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2: NLP and Analytics | FinBERT fine-tuning, Sentiment scoring, Price correlation, and Dashboard | 🔧 In progress |

## Key Engineering Decisions

### SHA-256 cryptographic deduplication
Every headline is hashed before insertion. The database enforces a `UNIQUE` constraint on `headline_hash`, and all inserts use `INSERT OR IGNORE`. This means duplicates are silently skipped at the database level instead of being caught in application code, preventing repeated news alerts from inflating downstream sentiment scores and avoiding expensive `SELECT` checks before every insert.

### market_date normalization
Raw article timestamps from NewsAPI are in UTC. A headline published at 23:00 EST cannot affect that day's closing price. The pipeline maps every timestamp to the trading session it can realistically affect:

- Published before 16:00 EST on a weekday: same trading day
- Published at or after 16:00 EST, or on a weekend: next weekday open

This normalization makes the (ticker, market_date) join between `sentiment_scores` and `price_data` statistically meaningful.

### Log returns over simple returns
Daily price returns are stored as log returns: 

$$\ln\left(\frac{\text{Close}_t}{\text{Close}_{t-1}}\right)$$

instead of simple returns: 

$$\frac{\text{Close}_t - \text{Close}_{t-1}}{\text{Close}_{t-1}}$$

Log returns are additive across time periods and are more normally distributed. The Pearson correlation engine in Phase 2 relies directly on these properties.

### Decoupled ingestion and inference
The scheduler writes headlines with `NULL` sentiment fields. The inference layer in Phase 2 reads unscored records via `get_unscored_headlines()` and writes labels back independently. Neither service needs to know the other is running, allowing the pipeline to safely accumulate data even before the model is deployed.

## Architecture

                                                              (observability — safe to run in parallel)
```

**Data flow:**

1. `scheduler.py` triggers `news_job` and `price_job` on configurable intervals
2. Each collector fetches data and returns normalised records
3. `db_manager.py` applies `INSERT OR IGNORE` deduplication and writes to SQLite
4. Every job execution is logged to `job_log` with inserted/skipped counts
5. `check_pipeline_health.py` reads the database and prints a live health summary

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- A free [NewsAPI key](https://newsapi.org/register) (100 requests/day on free tier)
- macOS, Linux, or WSL2

### Installation

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/Adam210503/finbert-sentiment-analytics.git
cd finbert-sentiment-analytics
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 1 — Start the pipeline

```bash
export NEWSAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
python src/scheduler.py
```

On macOS, wrap with `caffeinate` to prevent the system from sleeping and interrupting the scheduler:

```bash
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here caffeinate -i python src/scheduler.py
```

> **Tip:** To keep your MacBook running with the display off, lower screen brightness to zero rather than closing the lid. Closing the lid triggers a hardware sleep signal that `caffeinate` cannot override.

Both jobs run immediately on startup, then repeat on their configured intervals.

### Step 2 — Monitor the pipeline

Open a second terminal window (leave the scheduler running) and run:

```bash
python check_pipeline_health.py
```

This is safe to run at any time — it only reads from the database and does not interrupt active scheduler threads.

Example output:

```
────────────────────────────────────────
Pipeline Health  —  2026-05-14 09:45:01
────────────────────────────────────────
Total headlines      :  247
  Scored             :    0  (awaiting Phase 2 inference)
  Unscored backlog   :  247

Total price records  :   42

Last news ingestion  :  2026-05-14T09:30:02Z
Last price record    :  2026-05-14

Recent job history:
  news_job   09:30:02   inserted=31  skipped=8
  price_job  09:30:05   inserted=6   skipped=0
  news_job   05:30:01   inserted=19  skipped=4
────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Step 3 — Inspect the database directly

```bash
python view_data.py
```

## Limitations

- **Free-tier API constraints.** NewsAPI allows 100 requests/day on the free tier. The current configuration uses 18 requests/day (3 tickers × 2 fetches/day), leaving comfortable headroom. yfinance is an unofficial wrapper with no SLA.
- **NYSE holidays not handled.** The `market_date` normalisation advances past weekends but does not account for public holidays. Headlines published on a NYSE holiday are assigned to the next calendar weekday, which may itself be a holiday.
- **No GPU inference.** Phase 2 FinBERT inference will run on CPU. Expected latency is 200–800ms per batch of 16–32 headlines — acceptable for a scheduled pipeline, not suitable for live streaming.
- **SQLite concurrency.** SQLite is single-writer. The scheduler and the health check script should not both attempt writes simultaneously. In the current architecture this is not an issue — the health check is read-only.

---

## What's Next (Phase 2)

- Fine-tune `ProsusAI/finbert` on a custom labeled dataset (Reddit PRAW + NewsAPI headlines, ~1,000+ samples)
- Deploy fine-tuned checkpoint for batch inference against the `unscored_headlines` backlog
- Implement rolling Pearson correlation between daily mean sentiment and next-day log return
- Build event study: return distributions at t+1h, t+4h, t+24h following sentiment spike events
- Streamlit dashboard with analytics panel and live observability metrics
